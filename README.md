Name: Bhoomi Sharma
Description: I'm just one of the techies you find out there. What makes me different from them is my hard work and consisitency. I've started learning programming a few weeks ago,
and there is a long way to go. I for one am looking forward to all those new experiences.
Facts about me:
1. For me everything seems better with cofee :)
2. I'm a night owl.
3. I don't have a favourite music genre.
